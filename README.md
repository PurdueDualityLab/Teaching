# Teaching
The teaching materials of Prof. James C. Davis. These include:
- *ECE 461: Software Engineering*: An undergraduate course for junior/senior-level students
- *ECE 595: Advanced Software Engineering*: A graduate-level course. It is a sequel of ECE 461.
- *Misc.*: Assorted learning modules associated with his research work.

If you use these materials, please (1) Let me know! I love to hear about other people using my work; and (2) Do the courtesy of crediting me in your presentation -- a note on a slide would be fine.
